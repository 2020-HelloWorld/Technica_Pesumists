**Track:** Open Innovation
**Problem Statement:**
Despite having advanced next-generation firewalls in place, there remains a significant risk of unauthorized data transfer going undetected within the network.

- **Data Theft:** Data privacy and security is of prime importance in today’s world

- **Industrial Espionage:** Company Confidential Information in the wrong hands could be fatal
  
- **Insider Trading:** Individual interests can ruin a company’s relationship with it’s clients

**Solution:** NetSpect
An AI-ML based approach to detect and disrupt covert timing channel communication in computer networks (designed to work with a variety of network protocols and hardware configurations).

- Covert Channel Detection: Based on TTL, TCP and Inter Arrival Time of packets
- Covert Communication Prevention: Our “novel approach” prevents communication for all 3 detection methods
- 2-layer enhanced protection: Proactive and reactive measures implemented at 2 layers
